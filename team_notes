controller-gui will subscribe to the data and camera - sync them and then make a pretty display controller side

rov-data-pub will publish data that the ROV side pi is acquiring from sensors (controller-gui will grab this data and make it human readable)

cam is a ros2 foxy provided node from imagetools (cam2image) - no writing necessary. controller-gui will grab this and display it con side

rov-command-sub will subscribe to commands published by the controller

Important note: colcon may need the prereq downloaded like so: sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

There will be two separate ROS2 launch files to start the ROV nodes on the ROV Pi, and to start the controller file on the other

Would be beneficial to install rosdep
Also install usb-cam (sudo apt install ros-foxy-usb-cam)

Should also install pil image tk (sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3.imagetk)
